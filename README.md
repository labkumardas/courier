Description

   This Node.js project, developed using the Express framework, is a scalable and maintainable foundation that combines the power of Dependency Injection (DI) principles with the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). The application is designed to provide robust functionality for user and driver management, featuring APIs for user registration, driver registration, user login, and fetching driver profiles.

Key Features
    User and Driver Functionality:

    1. The project caters to two primary roles: "user" and "driver." It provides comprehensive APIs for user registration and login, as well as driver registration and profile retrieval.
    Dependency Injection Emphasis:

    2. With a strong emphasis on Dependency Injection (DI) principles, the project achieves loose coupling between components. This design choice promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability, making it easier to extend and modify the system.
    Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Approach:

    3. Following the principles of Domain-Driven Design, the application fosters a shared understanding of the problem domain between technical and domain experts. This approach facilitates effective communication and ensures that the software model aligns closely with real-world business concepts.
    Clear Separation of Concerns:

    4. The project's folder architecture demonstrates a clear separation of concerns, with dedicated directories for components such as controllers, repositories, services, and dependency injection containers. This structure enhances code organization and readability.
    Scalability and Maintainability:

    5. The project's design principles contribute to scalability and maintainability. As the system grows, the modular architecture allows for the addition of new features and modifications without introducing unintended side effects.

Environment Variables:

 Overview
    This project relies on certain environment variables to configure and customize its behavior. Environment variables are a way to pass configuration information to your application without hardcoding values into your code. They provide flexibility and security, especially when deploying applications to different environments.

Configuration
 
    This project relies on several environment variables for configuration. These variables are used in a separate configuration file located in the config folder. Here is a breakdown of the environment variables:

    PORT: The port on which the server will listen.

    API_PREFIX: Prefix for general API routes.

    API_PREFIX_USER: Prefix for user-specific API routes.

    DEBUG: Set this to true to enable debugging mode.

    MONGODB_USERNAME, MONGODB_PASSWORD, MONGODB_CLUSTER, MONGODB_DBNAME: MongoDB connection details.

    REDIS_PORT, REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PASSWORD: Redis connection details.

    TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER: Twilio API credentials and phone number for SMS functionality.

    MAIL_SERVICE, MAIL_USER, MAIL_PASSWORD, SENDER_MAIL: Email configuration for sending notifications.

    JWT_SECRET: Secret key for JSON Web Token (JWT) generation.

Setting Environment Variables
   To configure these variables, create a file named .env in the root of your project and add the necessary values:
        PORT=3000
        API_PREFIX=/api
        API_PREFIX_USER=/user/api
        DEBUG=true
        MONGODB_USERNAME=username
        MONGODB_PASSWORD=password
        MONGODB_CLUSTER=cluster-url
        MONGODB_DBNAME=database-name
        REDIS_PORT=6379
        REDIS_HOST=localhost
        REDIS_PASSWORD=redis-password
        TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-account-sid
        TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token
        TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your-phone-number
        MAIL_SERVICE=mail-service
        MAIL_USER=mail-user
        MAIL_PASSWORD=mail-password
        SENDER_MAIL=sender-email
        JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret

Security Considerations

Always treat environment variables containing sensitive information with care. Avoid hardcoding these values in your code and ensure that they are kept confidential. Regularly review and rotate credentials for enhanced security.
